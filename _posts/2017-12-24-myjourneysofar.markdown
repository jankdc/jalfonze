# My Journey So Far.

After having been away from creating music for almost 4 years, I was inspired to write the first song os this EP titled, "The Beach House" during my stay in Cape Tribulation located in The Daintree Rainforest, Tropical North Queensland. After playing this song at a few open mic nights, I decided that it was finally time to write a new EP, using my ongoing travel experiences as insiration. I finished this EP during my stay at the Secret Traveller's Inn, Alice Springs, in the Red Centre of Australia.
I decided that it was a good idea to go back to my roots as the acoustic, singer-songwriter genre, as I felt that this was a more fitted genre for a travelling musician such as myself. 

"My Journey So Far" is the many stories that I have heard and experienced first hand, moulded into one cluster of emotions and poetry, accompanied by music which best describes my personality. 

Come listen and be part of the journey!
